        <h1>What Is Smart Farming?</h1>
        <p>The essence of smart farming is the introduction of new technologies in agricultural activities.
            The use of drones, artificial intelligence, big data, IoT, satellites, and so on makes farming 
            and agriculture “smart,” allowing growers to optimize their work and get better results. All this 
            reduces the percentage of manual labor, lower financial costs, and increases production volumes,
            making agribusiness more cost-effective.</p>
        <p>Now the use of advanced technologies in farming is more relevant than ever. According to forecasts, the world’s 
            population will grow by 34% by 2050. It requires higher crop yields and optimized use of natural resources.
            Climate change is exacerbating the situation. All this makes the introduction of effective methods into the
            work a necessity. How could smart farming help local farming? Today’s service and technology providers offer
            growers access to tools and techniques to optimize literally every step of their activities, from monitoring 
            fields and using drones for pesticide delivery to creating the perfect greenhouse climate and harvesting.
            Climate smart agriculture is a separate approach that focuses specifically an impact of weather conditions
            on agricultural decision-making.</p>

        <h1>Smart Farming Benefits</h1>

        <p>The technical breakthrough that the agricultural sector has been experiencing in recent years can radically 
            change the format of work for both small farms and large enterprises. The introduction of modern farming 
            technologies is taking place at such a rapid pace that they are becoming available not only in developed 
            but also in developing regions.Just as digital technology makes many tasks more straightforward in the office, it can significantly
             improve work in the field. In general, smart farming provides growers with the following advantages:</p>
            <li>speeding up data collection and processing;</li>
            <li>increasing accuracy and precision level;</li>
            <li>enhancing production efficiency;</li>
            <li>reducing production costs;</li>
            <li>lowering the need for manual labor;</li>
            <li>minimizing driver stress;</li>
            <li>simplifying risk forecasting;</li>
            <li>streamlining task recording and reporting;</li>
            <li>boosting sustainability </li>

       <p>Robotic systems, drones, mobile apps, satellite images analysis, and other modern smart farming practices can be effective
             not only directly for farmers. They can be used by insurance agents, input suppliers, financial institutions, agriculture
             cooperatives, and so on.</p>

             <h1>Smart Farming Technologies</h1>

             <ol>
                <li><strong>Machine learning.</strong>Self-learning technologies give you the power to predict changes in climate,
                     soil and water parameters, carbon content, disease and pest spreading, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart farming sensors</strong> Sensitive sensors help farmers to monitor the slightest changes in the
                     state of the environment and fields in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Drones and satellites with cameras.</strong>With their help, growers can create regularly updated maps and 
                    monitor the territory remotely without the need to go to the field.</li>
                <li><strong>Big data.</strong>Without them, it is impossible to imagine the possibility of accurate forecasts, activity planning,
                     and designing more efficient business models. Smart farming and big data allow you to make long-term decisions and take 
                     action right now.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong>gives you the opportunity to combine all the tools and solutions into a single system.
                     All devices and software can exchange data and perform specific actions based on patterns.</li>
             </ol>
